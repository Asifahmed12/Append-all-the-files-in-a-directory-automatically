# Append-all-the-files-in-a-directory-automatically
In our official projects, we came across different situations where we have to automate our task to increase its efficiency. One of such task is to read all the files in a directory (including the folders and sub folders in it) and to append all these files. My name is Asif Ahmed and by profession I am a Data Analyst. I have create a code which I am going to share, that will read all the excel files in a directory and then append them and gives us a single output excel file. I have used this code multiple times and it is error free.

# About the code
There is user definde function, which will give a list of paths for all the files.
Then we will run a for loop which will read file one by one and pushed it to a list of dataframes.
At the end, we will append all the dataframes in a list

# What you need to do in a code

1. Change the "Path to your directory" in the code and paste the directory from where you want to read the files.
2. You can change the manipulation part in the For loop as per your requirement
